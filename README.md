This is a classic algorithm: Least Recently Used (LRU) BufferPool

The Least Recently Used or LRU is a function that keeps buffers in a list. This function moves the information contained in the buffer to the front of the list. 
information in the back of the list gets overwritten and uses the Least Recently Used function to organize data. all the information that is being currently accessed is 
being moved to the front of the list. It then uses a priority system to organize data and retrieve information. The purpose of these buffers is to optimize the inputs 
and outputs of main disk.
